## Intro

I am making my first foray into the world of open source software. I have been working on a project for several years, on the side when I had a job and full time when I didn't, that will automatically monitor and trade Forex Instruments. I will get into the details later when I release that project on GitHub.

The first project I am releasing is a C++ library that provides access to the [OANDA v20 REST API](https://developer.oanda.com/rest-live-v20/introduction/).
